Abstract DIPG data exchange scenario
---

Each site adheres to the DIPG regulatory document (and thereby GDPR).
Each site has an eflint server running locally, loaded with formal interpretation of DIPG regulatory document.
Each site has an application that:
  * is used to get approval for projects
  * is notified of accepted projects
  * allows donors/patients to give and withdraw consent
  * enables submitting algorithms for analysis on distributed data held by sites
The eflint server is notified of events in the application, causing MayAccess rules to be (re-)generated

Concrete DIPG scenario
---
Three sites: X, Y, Z

X, Y, Z have data assets: DX1,DX2 (at X), DY1,DY2 (at Y), DZ1,DZ2 (at Z)
all donors identifiable in DX*, DY* have given consent for DIPGresearch, but not DZ*

X gets approval for a project, datasets DY1, DY2 and DZ1 are selected by committee
X,Y,Z are notified

X does not generate `may-access` rules (DX* not selected)
Y generates `may-access` rules for DY1, DY2 (selected and consent)
Y does not generate `may-access` for DZ1 (no consent)
Z does not generate `may-access` for DZ2 (not selected)

The donors at Z give consent for DIPGresearch


Z generates `may-access` for DZ1 (consent given)
Z does not generate `may-access` for DZ2 (not selected)
